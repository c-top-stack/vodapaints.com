              <h1>Corporate Citizenship</h1>
              <p>Voda Paints Limited has, over the years, nurtured a sure-footed relationship with all its stakeholders - customers,
                employees, neighbours, commercial partners and the community, with the overall aim of ensuring a better relationship. In
                line with its disposition of ‘adding colour to your life...’ our corporate social responsibility (CSR) effort is a core

             <p>Voda Paints Limited recognizes that CSR efforts should not be mere PR campaigns designed to promote corporate brands by
                creating the appearance of being good corporate citizens; it must impact positively on those affected. This has led to
                the organization in pursuing several courses that seek to encourage the growth and development of the Voda 'people'.</p>
                
             <p> We are proud of our deep sense of social responsibility, and we are motivated by an awareness of the context in which
                our Company operates. Our Company was founded out of a commitment to improve the lives of people .The heart of our
                social commitment and our main business objectives are one and the same.</p>
              <h1> Internship Program</h1>
               <p>The Voda Paints Limited Internship Program is designed to serve a dual purpose – enable interns to provide useful
                assistance to the organization while also gaining on-the-job training that will assist them with their future career
                search and choice.</p>
                
               <p><b> Interns at Voda Paints Limited Internship Program go through an orientation process similar to that for new full-time
                employees. Incoming interns are therefore provided with information on the desired time frame of internship, the
                qualifications and skills sought by Voda Paints Limited Internship Program, potential activities that the intern will be
                undertaking (e.g. project based or job shadowing), expectations of the interns by Voda Paints Limited Internship Program
                and possible career choices for the intern on the basis of his/her capabilities and area of study. Work learning goals
                for the intern are clearly established and discussed. The hours of work and intern responsibilities are also clarified
                to the satisfaction of both parties.</b></p>
                 
               <h5>1. Long Range Planning</h5>
               <p>
                Voda Paints Limited Internship Program internship program is predicated on a number of key elements to ensure its
                success. Voda Paints Limited Internship Program plans in advance for its internship needs in order to ensure that both
                student and company derive the maximum benefit from the partnership. In planning and implementing its internship
                program, Voda Paints Limited Internship Program considers some of the following - workload and the availability of
                intern projects, staff support, office space and financial resources. The screening and selection of the appropriate
                candidate is carried out taking into consideration the needs of the company in order to find the best fit with applying
                candidates. Notices of openings for interns are posted one to six months in advance of the expected start date.
                 </p>
                <h5>
                2. Effective Supervision</h5>
                <p>
                Voda Paints Limited is fully cognizant of the fact that internships are of a training nature. In view of this, a
                considerable time investment is made in our interns. Seasoned staff are carefully identified and selected to supervise
                interns. Supervisors of interns are encouraged to plan ongoing weekly meetings to stay up-to-date with the intern's
                progress.
                 </p>
                <h5>
                3. Meaningful Assignments</h5>
                <p>
                Voda Paints Limited internship program assigns challenging projects and tasks to students. Effective assignments are
                coupled with adequate supervision so as to provide an information resource and to ensure that interns keep pace with the
                demands of their position. Interns are fully included in all organizational events and are provided with opportunities
                for networking and informational interviewing with key personnel of Voda Paints Limited.
                 </p>
                <h5>
                4. Compensation/Legal Compliance</h5>
                <p>
                All of Voda Paints Limited interns are compensated at the end of their internship with the company. Interns are taken on
                with the understanding that there is no promise of a job following the training.
                 </p>
                <h5>
                5. Appropriate Documentation</h5>
                <p>
                Voda Paints Limited believes strongly in the learning opportunity that internships provide to students. Mutually
                agreed-upon learning objectives are established for incoming interns from the onset of the program. Well-documented
                learning objectives are set to provide clear direction and targeted goals for the intern. These learning objectives are
                concise and measurable in order to ensure that both parties envision the same experience whilst reducing the possibility
                of misunderstanding and disappointment.
                Other aspects of Voda Paints Limited internship program are documented for ease of reference. These include internship
                job descriptions, eligibility and application requirements, compensation structures, supervisory roles, and
                supervisor/intern evaluations.
                 </p>
                <h5>
                6. Compensation</h5>
                <p>
                Voda Paints Limited internship program compensation package is based on receiving experienced volunteers. Most volunteer
                programs require volunteers to actually pay for their internship but Voda Paints Limited offers compensation on the
                basis of the experience and skills set of interns. The compensation and benefits package is as follows: <ul>

               <li>-Competitive Cash Stipend</li>
               <li>-Provision of basic accommodation</li>
               <li>-Provision of transportation to and from work</li>
               </ul>
               </p>
               <h5>
                7. Evaluation</h5>
                <p>
                At the end of the internship period, there is an evaluation process to elicit feedback from Voda Paints Limited interns.
                The evaluation focuses on the learning objectives that were identified at the start of the internship. Supervisors
                evaluate both positive accomplishments and weaknesses of the intern in order to be as constructive as possible. If an
                intern was unable to meet their learning objectives, suggestions for improvement are given.
                 </p>
